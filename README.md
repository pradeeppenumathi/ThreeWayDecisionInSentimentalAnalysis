The binary sentiment classification method faces challenges in handling uncertainty, prompting the 
introduction of a three-way decision approach to enhance classification accuracy in sentiment analysis. 
This proposed method targets critical sentiment classification scenarios i.e. interactive social media 
messages. In the era of social media, particularly concerning hate speech, initial conversations may exhibit 
uncertainty, which intensifies as comments increase in polarity. To counter this, a sequential three-way 
decision-making process continually refines uncertain regions within interactive information, scrutinizing 
uncertain samples at varying granular levels through a three-way decision framework. Utilizing BERT, raw 
text documents are transformed into vectors, subsequently undergoing feature selection to simplify 
sentiment analysis by reducing data complexity while preserving effectiveness. This multi-step process 
aims to improve sentiment classification accuracy by addressing uncertainty in interactive social media 
content.
